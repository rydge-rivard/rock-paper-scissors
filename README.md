# rock-paper-scissors
A simple implementation of rock, paper, scissors playable from the browser console (for now).

This was a quick exercise to practice JS functions.

May spend time in the future to refine the UI and fix bugs (if you input a non valid string, computer wins).

For now, marking this project as complete.
